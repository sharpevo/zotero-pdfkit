# PDF kit for Zotero

This is an addon for [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org). It adds two extra commands to right click menu for selected items.

1. Set as Default. Set default PDF to open when double click parent item, or click "View PDF" button, by manipulating Date Added, if you don't mind that field.
2. Copy URI. Copy a link to system clipboard. The link looks like "zotero://select/library/items/ITEMKEY", which opens Zotero to show the item when you click on it.

Install by downloading the [latest version](https://github.com/sharpevo/zotero-default-pdf/releases/latest)
